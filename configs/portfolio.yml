            Beepo is a robot built by Japanese robotics engineers with whatever information they had about Italian stereotypes. Upon his activation they uploaded the occupation "plumber" into his main fucking memory.

            In this world there are no humans around but somehow he always has a pipe to clean out or something to unclog. It's a very septic life. He tends to drink and do a lot of drugs, even on the job.

            But he also has a stereotypically Italian lust for life, and he sings Opera to all the beautiful women ... robots. Women robots.
